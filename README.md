# Titanic Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a Logistic Regression model predicting survival.  
It includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Visualizations to explore patterns and model correctness

## Key Results
- **Accuracy:** 83.5% on test data
- **Insights:** 
  - Model performs well predicting non-survivors.
  - Survivors are harder to predict; feature engineering may improve results.

## Visuals
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Side‑by‑side scatter plots comparing survival vs. prediction correctness

## Next Steps
- Add more feature engineering (family size, titles, cabin grouping).
- Test other models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Tune hyperparameters to boost performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peytonrivers/Titanic-Logistic-Regression.git
